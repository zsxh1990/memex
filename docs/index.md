# Memex Documentation

Memex is a long-term memory system for LLMs and humans. It ingests text, extracts structured facts and entities, retrieves them with multi-strategy search, and synthesises higher-order understanding through background reflection.

This documentation follows the [Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/) framework — four modes, each serving a different reader need. Pick the mode that matches what you're trying to do.

## Tutorials

Learn by doing. Step-by-step walkthroughs that end in a verifiable result.

| Guide | What you'll learn |
|:------|:------------------|
| [Get started with Memex](tutorial/getting-started.md) | Install Memex, start the server, create a vault, ingest your first note, and run a search. |
| [Build an agent against the REST API](tutorial/build-an-agent.md) | Wire a custom (non-Claude-Code, non-Hermes) agent to Memex via HTTP. |
| [Integrate Memex with Claude Code](tutorial/claude-code-integration.md) | Install the plugin, bind a vault to a project, save and recall memories. |
| [Walk through Memory Worth and deprioritization](tutorial/memory-worth-and-deprioritization.md) | Record outcomes, watch MW shift, see FSFM auto-band a low-MW unit, restore it. |
| [Walk through contradiction detection](tutorial/contradiction-detection.md) | Ingest conflicting notes, observe weakens/contradicts links, apply an LLM-proposed winner. |
| [Pick between note search and memory search](tutorial/note-search-vs-memory-search.md) | Decide when to use `memex_memory_search` versus `memex_note_search` versus `memex_survey`. |
| [Explore the entity graph](tutorial/entity-search.md) | Traverse entities and cooccurrences to answer relationship questions. |
| [Choose models for extraction, reflection, and embeddings](tutorial/which-models-work-well.md) | Swap extraction, reflection, and reranker models; observe the latency / cost / quality trade-offs. |
