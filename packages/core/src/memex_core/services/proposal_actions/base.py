"""Protocol + registry for maintenance-proposal actions.

A `ProposalAction` is a canned mutation paired with its inverse. The cockpit
shows them to the human as numbered options; the human picks one (or supplies
a free-form Other and maps it to a canned action); the server executes
`execute()` and stamps `prior_state` + `applied_state` into
`evidence.resolution.followup` so a later `reverse()` can roll the side
effects back. Reversibility is a binary class attribute — forward-only
actions declare `reversible = False`, and the `/reverse` HTTP endpoint
short-circuits to 409 with `{reason: 'forward_only'}` without writing an
audit row.

Actions are NOT free-form. The catalogue is hand-curated in the registry
and exposed verbatim to the CLI cockpit and (in a follow-on) the MCP layer.
