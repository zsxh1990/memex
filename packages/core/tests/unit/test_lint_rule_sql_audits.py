"""Standing-item unit tests for the F6 v1 rule SQL.

These are guards against contributor regressions that a future rule author
might introduce — they assert structural properties of the SQL strings that
must hold for **every** rule, regardless of what the rule actually checks.

Currently:

  * Every rule whose target is vault-scoped MUST include
    ``vault_id = :vault_id`` in its WHERE clause (otherwise a rule-run
    against vault A would also count vault B's rows in vault A's
    findings).
  * The :class:`RuleSpec` ``select_sql`` must yield a SELECT (not an
    INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) — guards the AC-F6-2 read-only invariant at the
    spec level.
  * Every rule's ``select_sql`` must project both ``target_id`` and
    ``evidence`` columns; otherwise the insert into ``maintenance_proposals``
    will fail at runtime.
